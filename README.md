# personal-headers
Some headers I use myself a lot. A lot of this is work in progress and not intended for public usage(use it if you want to but on your own risk)  I only uploaded this to Github so I can use it wherever I want to. It's all written for c but from what i can tell it should also work for c++

#how to compile
.c or .cpp do both work

on Linux
gcc main.c -o main -lm -lX11 -lpthreads

on Windows
gcc main.c -o main -lm -lpthreads
